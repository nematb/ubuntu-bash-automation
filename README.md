**NOTE:** Update the install paths!



Create file with:

```bash
touch script.sh
```

The shell needs to know what interpreter to run, and also to allow the script to be executable, the first line is:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Make the script executable with:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

And now, it is possible to run it just like any executable with:

```bash
./script.sh
```









**crontab** is used to automate tasks by running commands or scripts at a given date and time. You can schedule scripts to be executed periodically.
